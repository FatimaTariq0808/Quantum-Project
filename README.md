Quantum Computing Project

Description:

This project focuses on simulating quantum circuits with Qiskit, introducing thermal relaxation errors using a NoiseModel, and visualizing results using both local and IBMQ backends.

Installation:

Ensure you have Python and Qiskit 0.37.2 installed on your Linux machine.

1. Install Qiskit:
   pip install qiskit==0.37.2

2. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/FatimaTariq0802/Quantum-computing.git

Usage and Compilation:

1. Open Anaconda Prompt.
2. This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.
3. Open new notebook file open it.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code.

That's it! You should now be able to compile and run the code on your Linux machine using Anaconda Prompt to open Jupyter Notebook.
